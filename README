Buffer multiplier
========
**Warning**
Using this parameter might not work stable on your system. Read [760b3df](https://github.com/andersson/qdl/commit/760b3dffb03d2b7dfb82c6eac652a092f51c572d) for
more details.


To improve flashing speed buffer multiplier parameter was added.
It uses bigger buffers for sending data on USB what allows to flash
faster.

Measurements made on VM Linux Mint 21.1 and may vary compared to native
machine.
